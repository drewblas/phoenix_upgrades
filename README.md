# Phoenix Upgrade history

This repo tracks the output of running `mix phoenix.new` for each Phoenix version.

It also runs a few example CRUD generators so you can see how they changed as well.

It allows you to easily see the diff of changes from one version to the next to keep up to date. When a new version comes out you can update your app to match that boilerplate changes.

## Usage

To view the changes on GitHub, click the 'commits' link below the project description, and then click one of the commits to see how the generated project changed from the previous version to the selected one.  

Alternately, clone this repository and use the following commands:

* `./run.sh download` to download all the phoenix_new*.ez files
* `./run.sh reset` erases the git history to start anew
* `./run.sh build` builds each version in turn.  _You'll need to answer `n` to the dependency prompt._

## TODO

* Tag each git commit
